    "One of the most powerful tools we have in understanding probability is to *simulate* an experiment many times on a computer. We can frequently run thousands or millions of trials and gather a large amount of data regarding the typical outcomes, the average behaviour or properties of a system, and more. In this notebook, you'll start to see how we can use simulation to gather some data. We'll explore a few experiments involving dice rolls."

    "In this block, we'll roll a set of dice, average the rolls, and see what typical behaviour occurs. One way to \"roll a die\" numerically is to generate a random number between 0 and 1; then multiply it by 6 and round up to the next integer (we'll actually round down and add 1 because it's a bit easier to code...). Lots of things can be simulated this way, in fact! Generate a random number, choose a particular range of interest, and record a result."
