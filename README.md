## Information

JupyterNotebooks in python from my statistics and probability class of Math 32. Note to run/modify them you would have to go to JupyterNotebooks and open the .ipynb file. I left this college after 1 semester for UMGC as the B.S. offered there was not the one I want and I also wanted a minor, but the school did not offer it. UMGC offer the B.S. CS path that I wanted with a minor and addtional ceritifcates(CompTIA, Cybersecuity, etc). Some of these codes were inspired by my textbook and with the help of the other links below in the Aknowledgements.
